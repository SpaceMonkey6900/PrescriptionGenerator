# PrescriptionGenerator
I developed a software called Prescription Generator, designed to support doctors in conducting online consultations during the COVID-19 lockdown. 
This innovative tool empowered doctors to efficiently create and organize patient records while automating the process of sending emails and text messages regarding medical needs and appointments. Developed using Python, I leveraged Tkinter for the user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and incorporated several libraries for seamless file handling, email integration, and message sending services. 
To ensure utmost data security, I implemented encryption features, while also introducing unique and randomly generated Product Activation keys to deter any unauthorized distribution of the software. This project showcases my expertise in Python programming, GUI development, software architecture, and my dedication to utilizing technology for the betterment of healthcare services.
